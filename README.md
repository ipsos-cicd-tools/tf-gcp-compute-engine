# Committing to a GitHub Repository Using Semantic Versioning

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Semantic%20Versioning-brightgreen)

Semantic Versioning is a versioning scheme that helps maintainers and users of a software project understand the nature of changes between versions. When committing to a GitHub repository that follows Semantic Versioning, it's essential to adhere to certain guidelines to maintain version consistency and clarity.

## Semantic Versioning Basics

Semantic Versioning follows a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format, where:

- ![Major](https://img.shields.io/badge/MAJOR-red)![1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/1.0.0-grey) indicates incompatible changes (backwards-incompatible).
- ![Minor](https://img.shields.io/badge/MINOR-yellow)![0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/0.1.0-grey) denotes new features that are backward-compatible.
- ![Patch](https://img.shields.io/badge/PATCH-brightgreen)![0.0.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/0.0.1-grey) represents bug fixes and backward-compatible improvements.

## Commit Message Conventions

To maintain SemVer in your GitHub repository, commit messages should follow a specific convention. Each commit message should include:

1. **Type**: A one-word type that describes the nature of the change. Common types include:
   - ![Breaking_Change](https://img.shields.io/badge/BREAKING__CHANGE:-red) A major change that would break existing deployments (increment ![MAJOR](https://img.shields.io/badge/MAJOR-red)).
   - ![Feature](https://img.shields.io/badge/feat:-yellow) A new module introduced (increment ![MINOR](https://img.shields.io/badge/MINOR-yellow)).
   - ![Bug Fix](https://img.shields.io/badge/fix:-brightgreen) A bug fix (increment ![PATCH](https://img.shields.io/badge/PATCH-brightgreen)).
   - ![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs:-lightgrey) Documentation updates (increment ![NONE](https://img.shields.io/badge/none-lightgrey)).

2. **Description**: A brief, concise description of the change.

3. **Jira Task** (Optional): Add the task ID to the related Jira task or epic.
